The Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation (MoSPI) released the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), Key Employment and Unemployment Indicators, January–December 2024, which provided the unit-level data used in the study. Following the application of survey weights and design structure, the analysis is based on 164,046 employed people. Employed people who put in less than 35 hours a week are considered to be hidden underemployed. By comparing years of formal education with average education levels for a given occupation, skill mismatch is calculated and classified into matched and mismatched employment. Determinants of skill mismatch across age, sex, sector, employment type, and education are investigated using survey-weighted descriptive statistics, cross-tabulation analysis, and logistic regression models.

The findings highlight serious issues with India's employment quality. According to the national estimate, hidden underemployment affects 27.39% of employed workers (95% CI: 26.84–27.96). Compared to urban areas (17.30%), hidden underemployment is more prevalent in rural areas (31.39%). The prevalence is highest among casual workers (40.29%), followed by self-employed workers (25.57%), and comparatively lower among regular wage workers (9.41%). 63.96% of employed people suffer from skill mismatch, which is more common in rural areas (67.47%) than in urban ones (55.11%). The mismatch is higher among self-employed individuals (66.32%) and casual labourers (68.72%) than among regular wage workers (50.07%). According to the results of logistic regression, compared to self-employment, urban workers have significantly lower odds of mismatch (OR = 0.76, p < 0.001), whereas casual labour raises the likelihood of mismatch (OR = 1.11, p < 0.001). With predicted probabilities varying from 28.7% to 80.0% across education categories, higher education levels have a significant impact on mismatch probabilities. The effects of gender and age are not statistically significant.
